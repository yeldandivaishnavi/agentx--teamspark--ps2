Final Evaluation Metrics – AgentX (PS2)

Training Details:
- Environment: Grid-based maze
- Algorithm: Q-Learning
- Total episodes: 100

Performance Metrics:
- Average reward (initial episodes): -15
- Average reward (final episodes): +6
- Average steps to reach goal reduced over time

Observation:
AgentX initially explored the environment with low rewards.
As training progressed, the agent learned an optimal policy,
resulting in higher rewards and faster goal completion.
